          My name is Barbarossa and I'm well known in the poker community!
          During my past 15 years, I've been studying and crushing the highest
          stakes that I can find around the world. I've also taught some good
          and quite famous poker players around the world during this time and
          decided that it is time to spread all my knowledge to all people (that
          can afford this üòé).
